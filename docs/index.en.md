## Archives de la construction moderne

The [Archives de la construction moderne (Acm)](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/enac/acm/a-propos/) preserve and organize original documents (plans, models, photographs, etc.) related to the **built environment**.

Containing **technical, spatial, historical and social data**, these collections are structured according to the principles of [*information science*](https://graphsearch.epfl.ch/en/concept/149354), relying on archival standards and interoperable metadata models to ensure their long-term preservation and accessibility. These resources are available **to support research, teaching and interdisciplinary projects** led by ENAC faculty members and EPFL.
