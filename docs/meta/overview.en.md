# About this Wiki

This wiki was designed as a technical and collaborative documentation space to centralize knowledge, procedures, and tools related to our working environment.

It is based on [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme—two open source tools specifically designed for writing structured and readable documentation entirely in Markdown. It is hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Objectives

- Ensure knowledge is preserved within the team

## What is MkDocs?

MkDocs is a static site generator designed for writing technical or professional documentation. It uses the Markdown language, making content easy to write, read, and share. The generated sites are fast, lightweight, and easy to host—even on free services like GitHub Pages.

## What is Material for MkDocs?

Material for MkDocs started out as a simple theme for MkDocs, but has significantly evolved over the years. It now includes many built-in plugins, advanced configuration options, and a wide range of customization features.
