This guide explains how to use the script [`AtoM_Record_Updater.py`](#scripts-atom_record_updaterpy) to automate the editing of archival descriptions in AtoM by injecting metadata extracted from a DIP’s `METS` file.

This script is the **second step** of the process, after generating the `urls.csv` file using the [previous script](../AtoM-METS-merger/).

---

## Purpose

Once the `urls.csv` file has been generated, this script will:

- **Log in to AtoM** using a user account
- **Open each archival description** listed in `urls.csv`
- **Automatically populate** ISAD-G fields with metadata extracted from the METS file:
  - Title
  - Date of creation
  - Level of description
  - Extent and medium
  - Location of originals
  - Identifier / Reference code
  - Creation event

---

## Requirements

- The `urls.csv` file generated by the first script
- A `login.csv` file containing AtoM login credentials
- The script [`AtoM_Record_Updater.py`](#scripts-atom_record_updaterpy)
- Python installed on your system
- An active internet connection

!!! warning "Internet connection required"
    This script interacts with the AtoM web interface. It simulates user navigation, which requires a stable connection and access to the live AtoM site.

### Expected format for `login.csv`

The `login.csv` file must be located in the same directory as the script. It must contain two columns: `username` and `password`. Example:

```csv title="login.csv"
username,password
my_user,my_password
```
