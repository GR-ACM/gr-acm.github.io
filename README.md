## Archives de la construction moderne

The [Archives de la construction moderne (Acm)](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/enac/acm/a-propos/) preserve and organize original documents (plans, models, photographs, etc.) related to the **built environment**.

Containing **technical, spatial, historical and social data**, these collections are structured according to the principles of [*information science*](https://graphsearch.epfl.ch/en/concept/149354), relying on archival standards and interoperable metadata models to ensure their long-term preservation and accessibility. These resources are available **to support research, teaching and interdisciplinary projects** led by ENAC faculty members and EPFL.

## About this Wiki

This wiki was designed as a technical and collaborative documentation space to centralize knowledge, procedures, and tools related to our working environment.

It is based on [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme—two open source tools specifically designed for writing structured and readable documentation entirely in Markdown. It is hosted on GitHub Pages.

### Objectives

- Document our workflows and best practices  
- Facilitate onboarding for new team members  
- Ensure knowledge is preserved within the team  

> This wiki is constantly evolving. Feel free to suggest additions or corrections.

### What is MkDocs?

MkDocs is a static site generator designed for writing technical or professional documentation. It uses the Markdown language, making content easy to write, read, and share. The generated sites are fast, lightweight, and easy to host—even on free services like GitHub Pages.

### What is Material for MkDocs?

Material for MkDocs started out as a simple theme for MkDocs, but has significantly evolved over the years. It now includes many built-in plugins, advanced configuration options, and a wide range of customization features.
